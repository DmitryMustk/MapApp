## Short Description

The app simulates SMS verification flow:
1. The user enters a phone number (with masking for `+7` format).
2. A 4-digit code is simulated and shown in an alert.
3. The user enters the code. If it matches, the app navigates to a Map screen.
4. Buttons are animated for better UX.
5. Resending code is limited with a countdown timer.
